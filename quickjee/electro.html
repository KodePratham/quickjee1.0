                     <p>Semiconductors are a third class of materials, and their electrical properties are somewhere
                          between those of insulators and conductors. Silicon and germanium are well known example of
                         semiconductors.</p>

                    <h4>Principle of superposition of forces</h4>   
                </div>
                <div class="back">
                    <p>Coulomb's law stated above describes the interaction of two point charges. When two charges
                        exert forces simultaneously on a third charge, the total force acting on that charge is the
                        vector sum of the forces that the two charges would exert individually. This important
                        property, called the principle of superposition of forces, holds for any number of charges.</p>

                <div class="back">
                    <p>A charged particle cannot directly interact with another particle kept at a distance. A charge
                        produces something called an electric field in the space found it and this electric field exerts a force on
                        any other charge (except the source charge itself) placed in it.
                        Thus, the region surrounding a charge or distribution of charge in which its electrical effects can
                        be observed is called the electric field of the charge</p>
